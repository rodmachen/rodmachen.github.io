Busiest week so far learning to code. Last weekend seems far away.

Began the week continuing to work through the Pickaxe book&#8217;s tutorial, but quickly realized I wouldn&#8217;t get through all 200 pages. Still, I wanted to cover “the basics” from that book’s point of view. By Wednesday I got to p. 144, finishing the scopes, loops, and blocks chapter, though I still don’t understand scope well enough.

The biggest event of the week was attending the MakerSquare meetup on Tuesday. Nick led it, going over basic testing using RSpec. I knew this was a thing, so it was good to see it in action. I actually knew a decent number of the things he was referencing, so my month and a half of study hasn’t been a complete waste. It was good to see the MakerSquare facility and meet some people.

The next day I went back for a couple of chats. I talked to Amanda in admissions about how it all worked, then Nick and I tech-talked for the better part of an hour. We began on a tangent with him showing me git and how it relates to Github. I know I’ll be using that a heck of a lot in the future, so was nice. We talked about how I should use the next year if I’m possibly going to do the immersive class next summer. He gave advice on some books and resources, and we even talked a little about me starting to learn JavaScript.

Therein lies the big next step that’s now on my horizon. I started with Ruby, and I’ve always felt strongly that I need to learn one language before moving onto another. In order to finish my time with Ruby (for the near term, anyway) I’ve decided to go back to the beginning and complete Chris Pine’s Learn to Program. After all the other work I’ve done, I should be able to at least get through that book and its exercises. I’ve spent the last couple of days doing so, and it has been a lot of review. I’m 2/3 of the way through the part I had previously covered. If all goes well, I should be through with it by the end of next week.

I’m also starting a concurrent HTML/CSS track in my studies, starting with Codecademy. It’s all a bit rote at this point, but that’s kind of nice to balance out the mental workout Ruby is giving me.

After that, JavaScript. I’m very excited about this, a somewhat ridiculous notion given I’ve never coded a line of it, but if I can learn this language (and some of its offshoots), lots of creative endeavors await.

One more interesting event from this week. I went to the EdTech Austin meetup. Met Sean Duffy, who was very nice and someone with a similar background to mine. I’m looking forward to talking more with him in the future (and not just because we both have amazing beards.) The meeting was very business-centric, something way outside my comfort zone as a teacher, but it was good to see how the other half lives. I might not end up using my tech within ed, but it’s certainly a possibility.

On to next week. More meetups and study await.

There is much to learn.
