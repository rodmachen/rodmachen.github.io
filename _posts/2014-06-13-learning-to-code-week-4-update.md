Another &#8220;good news, bad news&#8221; week Learning to Code.

Good news: I finished Codecademy&#8217;s Ruby track. It is the first tutorial I have completed. Granted, it was very basic, and did lots of prompting, but almost without exception, I understood the concepts. It felt great to finish something and feel like I hit all the major components of this language I&#8217;m trying to learn. I followed that up with Ruby in 100 Minutes, following the prework track from MakerSquare. It took a little over a day and was a cursory review of what I had just learned. Next up was Ruby Monk.

Bad news: Ruby Monk kicked my butt. Not right out of the gate, but kick it did. About halfway through (why is it always halfway through?) I got to a point where I couldn&#8217;t complete the problems I was given. I had covered the appropriate sections, but I just couldn&#8217;t get through them. I do believe they are great problems, so I didn&#8217;t want to look at the answers. I&#8217;m going to go ahead and push through the rest of the tutorial and save these problems for when my skill level is higher.

Now I have to decide what to do for my next step. What tutorial will be the best thing for me to use given that I&#8217;ve now seen most of these concepts several times. The road ends with understanding, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m after.
