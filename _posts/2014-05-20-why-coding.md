This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve thought through entering the tech field as a programmer, but it is the first time I&#8217;m actually giving it a shot. So why coding?

First, why haven&#8217;t I ever done it before. I went to school at Texas A&M and was even an engineering and science major until switching late to journalism. As a freshman I took an engineering class that attempted to teach us Fortran. It was essentially a fail-out class, and it worked. I moved to the college of science after that. I was not a good student at the time, and Fortran was an arduous intellectual task. It defeated me.

Second, why make a switch from teaching to coding? Apart from the fact that I think I can do it, I hope to some day reach a level of flexibility that allows me to make a living while still raising a family and being engaged in other pursuits. The tech offices that I&#8217;ve been exposed to seem like decent places to work, though all jobs have their drawbacks.

There&#8217;s another reason that has creeped up on me. As I get started with actually learning to program for the first time in my life, the challenge has me excited. I just turned 40, and the idea of learning a completely new skill is invigorating.

I&#8217;ll try to keep up the optimism when I&#8217;m deep in the weeds of coding weeks and months from now.
