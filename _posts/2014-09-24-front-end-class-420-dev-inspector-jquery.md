My first introduction to the Chrome dev inspector came this summer while learning JavaScript. I had been working with Ruby, so my workflow involved creating a program in a text editor then running it in the terminal. When I switched languages, I didn&#8217;t know where to go. It literally took me several hours to figure out that I needed to bring up the JS console under Developer Tools in order to write out code. 

Now I know about JSFiddle and other helper sites, but the JS console was the thing. In class Wednesday, I finally learned to use the rest of it. I still can&#8217;t believe how big of a tool this is. I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface by inspecting and changing HTML and CSS elements. I, of course, giggled when I changed the headlines on the New York Times to say completely inappropriate things, but I know I&#8217;ll need to use this a lot more before I&#8217;m ready to be a web developer.

Next we used jQuery for the first time. I had actually put this part of the pre-work off until the very last because of the standard internet warning: Don&#8217;t just learn jQuery; learn JavaScript! I&#8217;m still finishing this tutorial, so it&#8217;ll be fresh on my mind. Most interesting thing I learned was about the nature of such libraries. They are not simply shortcuts, turning several lines of JavaScript code into one. If I were to look at the source code, it would be far more complex than that. Considering that I want to really learn JS as a language, this is fascinating. Maybe some day I&#8217;ll look at said code. Who knows? Maybe one one day I&#8217;ll understand it.
