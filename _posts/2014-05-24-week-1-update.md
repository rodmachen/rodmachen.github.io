After scouring the web for resources and direction, I finally did something useful this week and worked my way through Zed Shaw&#8217;sÂ [Command Line Crash Course][1]. This was a nice way to dip my toe in the way, and presages my use of his Ruby tutorial in the future.

Should out to Joshua Kemp. While searching for resources, I found his post &#8216;[How a Blacksmith Learned to Code][2]&#8216; which verified a lot of things I had researched.

Up next, Chris Pine&#8217;s &#8216;Learn to Program.&#8217; I bought the ebook, and I&#8217;m ready to get started.
