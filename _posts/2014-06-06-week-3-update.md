Another week, another roadblock. Got a good start going through Learn Ruby the Hard Way, but technology got in the way. (Ironic, no?)

About a third of the way through, I came to an exercise that required Ruby 1.9.3. Problem is, I&#8217;m running an old iBook with OS X 10.6 which will only allow 1.8.7. I have a new MacBook Air on the way, but for now I&#8217;m stuck. I decided to start over once again.

This time I went with Codecademy. It&#8217;s free, and reviews are generally positive. The entire enterprise takes place in the browser window, so my version of Ruby is of no consequence.

After a few screens, I knew this was the best thing I&#8217;ve done so far. The teaching is great, and the pace is perfect for me. By that I mean it&#8217;s slow. Really slow. But considering that I&#8217;m starting from ground zero, that&#8217;s perfect.

It has hints for times when I get stuck, and a Q&A forum for even bigger problems. By the end of the week, I have made it through six of 10 modules, and my understanding is as good as it&#8217;s been.

Week 4 should see me finish it. If my new laptop shows up, maybe I&#8217;ll go back to LRTHW.
