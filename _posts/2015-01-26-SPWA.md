title: Learning Functions from ‘Single Page Web Applications’

A couple of books have made their way into my orbit lately, and they both involved web applications. In my quest to Learn to Code, I've been stuck in the theoritical for a while now, and I'm jonesing to build something. Creating this web site was a good exercise, but while it involved plenty of tools I'll use as a developer, it didn't require much coding. Now, I want to start building.

My journey thus far mirrors the (wrongheaded) way I might learn a foreign language. I've spent weeks (sadly, more like months) learning how to conjugate verbs and match tense, but I'll be damned if I could hold a conversation. In JavaScript terms, I know the basics of arrays, functions, objects, etc., but I can't just sit down and build something. I've started to experiment with different coding-practice sites, but eventually I’ll want to be able to do more than solve homework problems. I have to admit, that solving something like FizzBuzz does give a little jolt to the little coder inside me.

In pursuit of this, I've been looking at two books, [Learning Web App Development](http://learningwebappdev.com/) by Semmy Purewal and [Single Page Web Applications](http://www.manning.com/mikowski/) (SPWA) by Michael Mikowski and Josh Powell. I’ll have more to say about the former another time, but the latter has been useful to me for an altogether different reason. 

I’ve had a goal lately to learn more about functions (shhh, more to come), and one of the best resources I’ve found was SPWA. Before they get into the business of building the app itself, Mikowski and Powell give a little JS primer to their audience. This wasn’t just another condensed beginner textbook; it explicated the how’s and wherefore’s of the topic with aplomb. Aplomb, I tell you! I knew a decent bit about functions for someone who hasn’t had to put them to work, but this book took it to a [whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAUOxQyxKv0) [‘nother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLgmR-HCCW0) [level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJnGRuidOXI). 

One example to concretize my praise: when addressing variable hoisting within a function, I had never understood that the variable declaration gets hoisted, but the variable definition doesn’t occur until the statement itself. This is a small thing, but the nuance had been lost on me until now. That was one of a dozen 'a-ha' moments I had reading this chapter.

Now it goes back up on the proverbial shelf until I’m ready to attack the meat of the book and build a single page web app. Here’s to hoping that happens sooner rather than later.
