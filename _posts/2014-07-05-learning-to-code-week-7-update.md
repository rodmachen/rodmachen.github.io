This week was a pivot. My adventure learning to code finally switched languages with Ruby being replaced by JavaScript.

I went into the week thinking I should spend it on finishing up with Ruby. That doesn’t mean I would have mastered it, but at least finished the book I was working on and found a nice stopping place. Saturday morning, that’s where I was at, but by the afternoon, I was ready to move on.

My time with Ruby was fruitful but problematic. After having gone through the Codecademy and Ruby Monk Primer tutorials as well as working through the opening section of the Pickaxe book, I found myself still stymied by easy problems. I think I had taken in a lot of information, but hadn’t gotten comfortable with it to the point of being able to put it into practice. Instead of beating my head up against the wall, I decided to move on. This doesn’t mean I’m done with Ruby, but it is on my back burner for now. I hope to use some of the lessons (and concepts) I learned and apply it to my next challenge.

For a while now, I’ve known that JavaScript was going to be my next target, so I was mentally prepared to make the switch. Coming up with the resources I would use was more difficult. With Ruby, I had a nice set of online tutorials and books that were universally acknowledged to be “the way to go.” With JavaScript, I had to start that discovery process all over again.

I ended up with a guide, and I think it’s a good one. <a href="How%20to Learn JavaScript Properly" target="_blank">How to Learn JavaScript Properly</a> not only has a straightforward title but breaks down an 8-week program for learning the language. It uses what appears to be best-in-class books and resources and lays out the order in which to attack them.

So far, so good. I had to finish the Codecademy HTML/CSS course before I began, but that happened quickly enough. I’m now making my way through the curriculum after having chosen JavaScript: The Definitive Guide as my book. I was torn between that and Professional JavaScript for Web Developers, but the former was touted as a bit better for beginners. Good enough for me. And I still have the other one to go to in the future.

I have supplemented this course with two other resources. First is the book <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/2nd_edition/preview/index.html" target="_blank">Eloquent Javascript</a>. It is a lot easier than the other two and is a perfect way for me to familiarize myself with the concepts. It also has sample problems at the end of each chapter, and I was able to complete the first two, which was a huge confidence boost.

I also discovered the godfather of JavaScript, Douglas Crockford. I’ll hold off on reading his book, JavaScript: The Good Parts, but I found one of his video lecture series. Over 10 hours of JS talk. I enjoy his speaking style, and even though I only understand about a quarter of it, it’s been a nice supplement.

I’m only a few days into it, but I couldn’t be more excited about learning JavaScript. Not only is it imminently useful, but extremely employable, and very scalable with all of the frameworks and applications being used with it. Before you know it, I might just know the MEAN stack!
