Learning JavaScript continues. This week I was on vacation, but still managed to get work done.

I finished weeks one and two of Learn JavaScript properly. That meant finishing the chapters on expressions and statements in The Definitive Guide as well as the accompanying Codecademy sections.

One thing I’m beginning to understand is that I have to keep up a certain pace, even if it’s not all making sense. I’ve seen that every concept will have to be gone over multiple times and then put into use multiple times to truly understand it. Since I’m not in the front end world, that means eventually web sites will have to be built. Reading about a concept and then using it on a problem is enough for now. The concepts that are most important will be the once required to make my site work.

In starting weeks three and four, I’m getting closer to that day when I’ll turn this theory into practice. I can feel that my learning will take off when I reach this point. Until then, I’ll continue to read and work without any unnecessary analysis by paralysis.

There’s a build coming; I can feel it.
