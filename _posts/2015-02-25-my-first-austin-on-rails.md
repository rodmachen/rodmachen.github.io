I’ve been going to meet ups for a while, but I’ve never gotten around to visiting Austin on Rails. This makes sense when you consider I’m not learning Rails, or Ruby for that matter. It’s reputation is top notch, however, and I’ve met Damon Clinkscales on a couple of occasions. This week was all lightning talks, and a few piqued my interest, so off I went, braving actual-winter weather in usually winter-less Austin. Here’s what jumped out at me.

**Tim Tyrrell on React.js**

Tim’s a trip. He did his damnedest to squeeze 30 minutes of material into five, and the audience got a kick out of it. The stuff he did get to was good. I’m just learning what React is all about, and Tim shared some of the nuts and bolts of using Facebook’s up-and-coming framework. I’m sure I’ll give it a crack some day, and I’m also sure that if I’d talked to Tim for any longer than I did, he would have convinced me to come to the next local React meet up. Maybe next time.

**Brandon Hays on the Asset Pipeline**

Brandon is a guy I’ve known about for a long time but had never met. He appears regularly on Kyle Simpson’s Twitter feed, even though he’s ostensibly a Ruby guy. His talk was about the asset pipeline and the multitude of build tools available to the modern dev. I can sympathize with how overwhelming it can be. I use Grunt, but didn’t create my own set up. I pretty much just know how to serve it locally and build before pushing my code. And to top it off, if I ever dedicate myself to learning one of these tools, it’ll probably be Gulp. Brandon introduced a new player I had never heard of: Ember-cli. He’s an Ember guy (I’m sure he could rope me into that meet up, too) so he’s obviously used this one a bit. It’s fascinating that these frameworks are spawning build tools now. Everything’s its own environment, I suppose.

**Alejo Rivera on Learning Techniques**

This relative newcomer to the development game (though still a seasoned veteran compared to me) shared three resources for learning new skills: podcasts, book clubs, and learning streaks. I learned of a couple new podcasts from this talk, like Giant Robots and the Bike Shed. These are Ruby-centric, but I still found some episodes worth downloading. Alejo’s book clubs are often several people each reading a different book on the same subject. Seems like a good way to learn. The learning streak is definitely good advice. It works for Jerry Seinfeld!

**Randy (@randito) on . . . Installing Wood Floors?**

Yep, we had a home improvement segment right in the middle of a bunch of tech talks. Turns out, it was a metaphor! Like anything worthwhile, the installation of flooring is hard. Web development is similarly hard. Both can be accomplished by following some of the same practices: know your materials, keep a steady pace, don’t give up. Nice talk with both words of wisdom and a touch of inspiring rhetoric. From a guy named Randito. 

**Nola Stowe on Jekyll**

Easily my favorite talk of the night, because I actually know Jekyll! Nola has recently helped reboot the Austin on Rails web site and decided to use Jekyll. She went through some of the technical components of setting up a site using Jekyll as well as some of its advantages over Wordpress and the like. This was an empowering talk for me to hear, because it showed me that the things I have learned on my journey learning to code are things other people might actually want to hear about. Now, I just have to get myself up there behind the podium one of these nights. Hoo boy.

The talks by Nathan Ladd John Dalton were probably great, but they were firing way over my head. I finally got to hear Nick McDonnough talk about Clojure, and Chad Bailey talked  JSON in Postgres. He was even nice enough to talk about the basics of databases with me afterward.

All in all, a good night. Maybe next time I’ll wonder down to 6th Street for some socialization afterward. This seems like a good group for that.
