title: A Typical Day
category: code

Today was the perfect day of coding. Completely typical for this enterprise. Typical in that I attempted to complete a task, ran into a bunch of obstacles, and had to keep plugging away. In other words, what I’ll spend half of my time doing as a professional developer. 

I decided to experiment with adding an image slider to my Foundation test project. Orbit used to be the standard one, but it’s been depricated. Slides.js was suggested, and I gave it a go. The details really don’t matter, but it was a combination of things that led to my problems. What’s funny is, as I chased the error-rabbit, I found several things that were wrong. I’d fix one, thinking it was the problem, but there’d be another problem higher up the chain. Correctly spelling the path to an image is important, but so is making sure the correct CSS and JS files are being linked, even if they’re in different places than the documentation says they’ll be. I backed into a great debugging tool, the JavaScript console for telling me which files weren’t loading correctly. 

It’s these experiences that will teach me the most. I know that. My patience-muscle must be exercised if I’m going to build it up for the long haul. I have to not give up because things will fall into place if I keep at it. Might take a while, but that’s the way these things go.

One more thing: I still don't have a working slider. The errors are gone, but it's not displaying correctly. On to another day.
