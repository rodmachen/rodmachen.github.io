The class officially began on Monday, but tonight it actually got going. The big in-class focus was on using Git, and the homework is HTML heavy, with several web pages needing to be manually created.

    We walked slowly through all of the parts of Git&#8217;s version-control protocol. We set up Github, and then used Terminal to add, commit, and push, terms that are not as obvious as they seem, and still don&#8217;t make 100% sense at a gut level for me. I think using Git will make it all more clear.

    Our first language (yeah, it&#8217;s a language) to explore was naturally HTML. Divs, boxes, margins were all discussed, with lots of foreshadowing of more complicated topics to come. At the end of the class, we started on our homework which is essentially a personal blog, concerned mainly with this class itself. I&#8217;ve already been blogging at code.rodmachen.com, but I think everyone at MakerSquare has recognized the value of students generating reflective writing throughout the course, and are now working that into the curriculum of this front-end class. Having to create a blog from scratch will certainly make me appreciate a CMS like WordPress, as problematic as all of those platforms are.

    I&#8217;ll finish the homework before class on Monday, and I look forward to what&#8217;s next on the agenda. I&#8217;m expecting my brain to be even more stuffed.
