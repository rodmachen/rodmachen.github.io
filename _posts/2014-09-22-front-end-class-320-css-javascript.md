This was the day we finally completed introductions to the holy trinity of web development with sections on both CSS and JavaScript. I&#8217;ve known what CSS is in theory, but working with it has helped a lot. Now I can&#8217;t look at an HTML-only web page without thinking, &#8220;Come on! Slap some CSS on there, please.&#8221; Classes and IDs were introduced, and I have a feeling they will be huge.

We finally got to JavaScript, the language I spent most of the summer learning. It felt good to recognized most of what Flip went over, and it made me realize just how much I&#8217;ve learned. There are fairly complicated topics that I understand but only because I spent time this summer grinding it out. Now I have to put it to use. Also, Flip is a trip.
