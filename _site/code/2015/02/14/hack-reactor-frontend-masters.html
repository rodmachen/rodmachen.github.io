    <p>Sometimes things just drop into your lap. That happened to me this week  with a JavaScript resource so perfectly timed as to make it seem–I don’t know–divine?</p>

<p>On Monday I got the news that my first technical interview with Hack Reactor for their Remote Beta program didn’t go as well as I would have liked. I wasn’t granted admission, but instead advised to study for another month and then try again. Instead of being discouraged, I was encouraged and sought out the best way for me to spend the next four weeks.</p>

<p>Along came a serendipitous tweet across my timeline. Frontend Masters announced an upcoming class from Kyle Simpson (Getify). That piqued my curiosity, so I went to look at their offerings. There, at the top of the page, was exactly what I had been looking for.</p>

<p>Less than a month ago, Frontend Masters published a course called “JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS.” The kicker? It was from Hack Reactor. After doing a little research, I learned that this was essentially their “Hack Reactor Jr.” course that they teach on nights and weekends to help people get admitted to the school. Not only that, it was taught by one of the instructors from that program, Bianca Gandolfo.</p>

<p>The main area I need to study is higher-order functions. Low-level functional programming, essentially. I had been reading up on closures, callbacks and the like, but it obviously wasn’t enough. The interview showed me the limits of my knowledge. I knew what a callback was, but wasn’t comfortable calling a function with another function. The passing of variables back and forth really messed me up.</p>

<p>That was Monday. Fast forward to this weekend, and I’ve finished the course. It’s over seven hours long and was recorded over two days. I’m glad I had longer to complete it so the concepts could soak it. The exercises at the end of each section were just challenging enough to push me without pulling me under.</p>

<p>Given how excited I was to see this course offering, Frontend Masters monthly fee of $40  seemed exceedingly reasonable. I’m now looking at which course to try next as I continue to master functions in JavaScript. It looks like Getify’s “Advanced JavaScript” and Douglas Crockford’s “JavaScript the Good Parts” will fit the bill.</p>

<p>Just 12 more hours of JavaScript. No big deal.</p>

<p>Now, back to work.</p>
