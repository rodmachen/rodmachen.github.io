    <p>Tonight was the first time I have actually prepped for class. Usually, I’m lucky to show up with a working brain, but I had a little more time this weekend than usual.</p>

<p>Some of that prep was completing old homework. I knew we were starting on <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" title="Zurb Foundation">Foundation</a> tonight, so I figured I should finally finish my CSS grid assignment. I got stuck, but luckily Clare helped me out before class in finishing it up. Glad she did, because a lot of that came into play as the night went on.</p>

<p>Like any good obsessive, I spent a ton of time Googling information not only about Foundation, but also frameworks in general. I now know the name of a half dozen different ways to make a gridded web site. One in particular, <a href="http://gumbyframework.com/" title="Gumby">Gumby</a>, has me intrigued. I might have to play with it after class is over. For now, Foundation.</p>

<p>We started class by talking about responsive web design. I knew the basics, but it was good to hear the details of how to go about making such a site, especially the “mobile first” mantra. It gave me a lot to think about for my final project.</p>

<p>We then downloaded Foundation and got it set up. From there, we finished it out with work on the newspaper project. Easily the homework assignment I’m most looking forward to. I think I’ll have a good grasp of Foundation basics after this.</p>

<p>Mae didn’t want to go with the Sass version, and that’s probably best at this point. However, I know I’m going to learn it at some point. I’m convinced that I want to be proficient in building web sites, and using pre-existing tools is going to be a part of that. I don’t need to build from scratch when I can get 90% of the value out of these frameworks and libraries. Where I want to put my energy is into learning languages and programming fundamentals. This stuff is just to baseline of knowledge about front-end site creation.</p>
